# Portfolio Project with React + Vite

Welcome to my portfolio project! This web application is built using React and Vite. Below, you'll find a brief description of React and Vite, followed by instructions on how to set up and run this project locally.

## React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently. React's declarative syntax and component-based architecture make it a powerful tool for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

## Vite

Vite is a fast, modern build tool for web development. It focuses on providing a lightning-fast development experience by leveraging native ES Module imports. Vite supports various frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and more, making it an excellent choice for building modern web applications.

## Project Description

This portfolio project showcases my work and experiences. The application consumes data from `.json` files stored within the project directory, allowing for easy management and customization of content. It utilizes React components and props to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.
